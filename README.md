## TFM Server (GoLang)

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This project was originally created as a way for me to **learn GoLang**. Looking back, it features a **very poorly structured codebase** and is **not suitable for production use**.

The server attempts to replicate basic TFM functionality in Go, but is incomplete and buggy.

---

### Known Bugs & Issues

-  **High ping / performance issues**
-  **Multiplayer synchronization is unstable**
-  **Map timer doesn't work for automatic map rotation**
-  **Disconnected players are not removed properly**

---

### Code Overview

The project includes:
- Basic TFM protocol handling
- Player data parsing
- Simple map loading
- Basic in-memory game logic (no persistence)

Feel free to fork or browse for reference, but don't expect it to work well in its current state.
